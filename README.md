# Public git repo for my personal site

## How to run it

_This readme will use pnpm because I like pnpm. That doesn't mean you need to._

1. clone the repo
2. run `pnpm i` in the project root, or your preferred alternative
3. create a .env file containing your desired variables. I have documented these in a separate section below.
4. either run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build` and you're good to go
